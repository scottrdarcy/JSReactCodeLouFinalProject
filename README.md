Project Description:

This app is a useful tool for anyone that trades stocks.  It comes in handy when you are out and about, and you hear a good stock tip.  When the app is fully functional, it will allow the user to simply take his phone out of his pocket and record a good stock tip.  A recorded stock can also be classified so that that person can deploy there customized strategy for how to take action on that selection.  
The goal is to add further fucntionality.  This app will eventually have alerts and customized tables so that trading can be done in a manner that allows the investor's to never mis out on an opportunity.  The financial industry has plenty of great tools to help you find a great pick, but the tools for classifying opportunities is limited.  

I built this because I plan to use it!  



Directions on How to use the App:

The app currently has limited functionality.  When the app is complete, the user will be able to enter a new Stock Ticker Symbol right into the home page.  There will also be categories so that the user can classify the stock.  Is the stock showing a certain pattern, and insdustry climate can be recorded.  Then a determination cab be made on how to treat the potential opportunity.  Shoud you look at this information again later in the year?  When everything is recorded you press submit and the data is sent to server and stored.  

The app also has two other features that are in development.  The API page currently lets the user know when the market is open or closed, but later this could be customized data. The Web Development Journal is also there to record ideas and changes to the site.  This inforation is also stored offsite. 

Project Requirements for Deploying the App:

To Deploy the App the following will be Required-
1.)  Lap top
2.)  Text Editior
3.)  Node.js and Node Package Manager
4.)  Create React App 
5.)  Git Bash (or other Terminal)
6.)  A GitHub Account



Additional Information:
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
